# VBA_Challenge

## Overview of Project
To sum up this project, we were responsible for creating a macro-enabled worksheet with the data given to write VBA script in order to report a user friendly version of what stocks performed the best in 2017 and 2018. The client was focused on a secific stock as they thought it was the highest performing, however, upon completion of this project we came to the conclusion that there were much better options.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to analyze the 12 different stocks that were given to us by the client. We were initially tasked with finding out more about the performance of stock DQ and then this grew into finding the performance of al 12 stocks over a span of 2 years. 

## Results
The results of this preoject were quite obvious. Due to the conditional formatting added to the Return column, we can see that there are a lot more positive returns in 2017 as there were in 2018. We can also see that DQ was the highest performing stock in 2017 but took a turn for the worst and actually became the lowest performing stock in 2018. As we can see by the pictures uploaded below, the best stock to ivest in would be ENPH as it has had positive returns for both 2017 and 2018.

## Summary

### Advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
The advantages for refactoring code far outweigh the disadvantages. Some advantages include making the code more efficient, more user friendly, and easier to understand. These are all advantages because they provide a better experience to both the programmer and the end user. Writing working code is always the first step but making the code more user friendly and easier to understand can lead to a huge advantage in the long run because it can save a lot of unnecessary question asking.
Some disadvantages would be that refactoring may take a bit of time to complete, especially when working with long complicated code. This can cause a programmer to run out of time and the employer to run out of money.

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
The pros apply to refeactoring the original script because of the fact that the original code was longer and more complicated than it needed to be. By refactoring we were able to get the code to run in a shorter amount of time and we were able to make it easier to understand for when the next programmer has to come in and make changes. As this was our first time refactoring code, it took a bit of time to get completed. This could pose as a potential issue in the future but with enough practice we should be able to write working and efficient code a lot quicker!
